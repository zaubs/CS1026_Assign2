This file is for the second assignment in the course CS 1026A, and it goes through a given list of school courses and it finds important course names,
unique majors for provided course sections, average marks from students in a given course, if students enrolled have paid their tuition, if courses
have an exceeding amount of students and if any course timeslot passes through noon.
